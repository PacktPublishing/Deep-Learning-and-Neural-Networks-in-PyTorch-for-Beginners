# Deep Learning and Neural Networks in PyTorch for Beginners		
This is the code repository for [Deep Learning and Neural Networks in PyTorch for Beginners](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/deep-learning-and-neural-networks-pytorch-beginners-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest topic currently out there, there's no doubt about that. This is the future. Neural networks in particular have seen a lot of attention and they will be used everywhere -self driving cars, predictions in finance and sales forecasts - everywhere and across all industries. To be successful in the working world of tomorrow we have to expose ourselves to this interesting topic - and from the author's personal experience - coding your own neural network is the best way to understand how they work. Besides TensorFlow there is a new very interesting deep learning framework which is developed by Facebook - PyTorch. A challenge? Indeed. But together we can do it. Excited? I hope so. See you in the first lecture. Let's get into it.
